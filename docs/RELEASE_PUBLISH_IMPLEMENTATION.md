# Release Publish E2E Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of E2E test coverage for the `devkit avs release publish` command in the devkit-cli CI/CD workflows.

## Implementation Status

### Requirements vs Reality

**Original Requirement**: "calling release and also querying the contract after to make sure the values there are correct"

**Current Implementation**: The tests attempt to query the ReleaseManager contract, but fail because the contract is not deployed in the local devnet environment.

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. CI/CD Workflow Updates

**E2E Workflow (.github/workflows/e2e.yml)**
- Local Docker registry setup on port 5001
- AVS image building and pushing to the registry
- Configuration updates to use the local registry
- Release publish command execution
- **Fails at contract verification** because ReleaseManager is not deployed

**Release Workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml)**
- Similar test steps in the smoke-test-binaries job
- Tests across different platforms and architectures
- **Also fails at contract verification**

#### 2. Test Infrastructure

**Test Script (scripts/test-release-publish.sh)**
- Checks prerequisites (Docker, devnet, tools)
- Verifies AVS deployment
- Manages local Docker registry
- Executes release publish command
- **Fails when trying to verify contract state**

**Release Script Template (testnet/.hourglass/scripts/release.sh)**
- Accepts version, registry, and image parameters
- Extracts Docker image digest
- Returns operator set mapping JSON (only operator set 0)

### Critical Limitations

1. **ReleaseManager Not Deployed**
   - The local devnet does not deploy the ReleaseManager contract
   - Tests fail when trying to verify contract state
   - This means the core requirement is NOT met

2. **No Real Contract Verification**
   - Cannot query the contract to verify release data
   - Cannot confirm that the release was actually published on-chain
   - Only verifies that the command runs without errors

3. **Incomplete Operator Set Testing**
   - Release script only returns operator set 0
   - Multiple operator set testing is not actually implemented

## What Would Be Needed

To properly implement the requirements:

1. **Deploy ReleaseManager in Devnet**
   - Modify the devnet setup to include ReleaseManager deployment
   - Ensure the contract is available at the expected address

2. **Implement Proper Contract Queries**
   - Query `latestVersion()` to verify version increment
   - Query `getRelease()` to verify release data
   - Validate digest and upgrade-by-time values

3. **Fix Operator Set Handling**
   - Update release.sh to handle multiple operator sets properly
   - Test with actual multiple operator set configurations

## Conclusion

The current implementation does NOT fully meet the requirements. It sets up the infrastructure for testing but fails at the critical step of verifying contract state because the ReleaseManager contract is not deployed in the test environment.
